I experiment with the future of work, using applied AI.  
When people are given AI tools, how do they know what they can do better, faster, or differently, where the difference actually matters?  

They don't. Not at first. They discover it by experimenting, by failing, by finding the edges where AI amplifies and where only humans can act.  
This was true when GPT-3 captured mainstream attention. It remains true today.

Here's what I've learned: **AI is replacing work.** That's real. But it's also opening doors that were closed before, things people couldn't attempt alone.  

You can just build things now!  
I know this because I've lived it.  

I've **chosen**to adopt AI playfully across every area of my life. From [startups](https://askrally.com/) to designing a [custom gravel bike](https://howlerbikes.com/), I’ve leaned on AI heavily to tackle new challenges.  

And I love it! It’s **empowering**.  
That's what I think the future of work looks like for a lot of people. Not just "doing your job faster," but discovering what you can become when the old barriers fall away.  

I call this **augmented agency**: AI as a lever for human becoming, not just human doing.  

The question is: what could you become if you get equipped with AI?  

That’s what we can figure out together.

## Recent Work

**[AskRally](https://askrally.com/)** – What if running focus groups didn't cost thousands of dollars and weeks of scheduling, but instead, insights landed in minutes?  

The goal of this project is to train AI on **real human opinions** so you can switch on an always-on voice of [enter your persona of interest]. It works like an LLM: you ask a question and get **role-played replies back**, dozens of them.  

I drove a lot of the early [use case exploration](https://askrally.com/articles) and, when the API dropped, explored **[automated workflows](https://askrally.com/workflows)**, some of which made it into the product (e.g., [video reaction generation](https://askrally.com/article/reels-reaction-simulator-examples).
