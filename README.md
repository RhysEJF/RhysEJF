I experiment with applied AI. What it changes, what it enables, what it makes possible.

When people are given AI tools, how do they know what they can do better, faster, or differently, where the difference actually matters?  

They don't. Not at first. They discover it by experimenting, by failing, by finding the edges where AI amplifies and where only humans can act.  

This was true when GPT-3 captured mainstream attention. It remains true today.

So I've been asking myself. What does this actually mean? Here's what I've landed on.

AI is replacing work. That's real. But it's also opening doors that were closed before, things people couldn't attempt alone.  

You can just build things now!  
I know this because I've lived it.  

I am activly adopting AI across my whole life. From [startups](https://askrally.com/) to designing a [custom gravel bike](https://howlerbikes.com/), things I might not have dared attempt before. It's become a daily practise. And I love it!  

That's the future of work I believe in. Not just "doing your job faster," but discovering who you can become when the old barriers fall away.  

I call this augmented agency. AI as a lever for human becoming, not just human doing.  

I'm still figuring this out. But if you feel I can help, let's talk.

## Recent Work

**[AskRally](https://askrally.com/)** – What if running focus groups didn't cost thousands of dollars and weeks of scheduling, but instead, insights landed in minutes?  

The goal of this project is to train AI on real human opinions so you can switch on an always-on voice of [enter your persona of interest]. It works like an LLM: you ask a question and get role-played replies back, dozens of them.  

I drove a lot of the early [use case exploration](https://askrally.com/articles) and, when the API dropped, explored **[automated workflows](https://askrally.com/workflows)**, some of which made it into the product (e.g., [video reaction generation](https://askrally.com/article/reels-reaction-simulator-examples).)
